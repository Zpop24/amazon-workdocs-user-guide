# Sharing by Invite<a name="share-invite"></a>

You can send an invite to share a folder or file with other users and groups both within and outside your organization\. When you share by invite, you choose which permissions to grant to the users that you're sharing with\. If you share a folder, the permissions for that folder apply to all the documents inside the folder\.

**To share a folder or file by invite**

1. In the web client, open the folder or file\.

1. In the document control pane, choose **Share by invite**\. 

1. In the **Share by invite** dialog box, start typing the name of the person or group in your organization with whom to share, and select the desired name when it is displayed in the list\. If your Amazon WorkDocs administrator has authorized you to share files with people outside your organization, you can also enter email addresses for external people and add them to the list of people with whom to share the folder or file\. 

   Repeat this step for any others you want to share the file with\.

1. Select the desired permissions for the folder or file\.  
**Co\-Owner**  
The users/groups are co\-owners of the file or files in the folder\. They can rename and delete files, and share the file or files with others\.  
**Contributor**  
The users/groups can provide feedback on the file or files in the folder\.  
**Viewer**  
The users/groups can only view the file or files in the folder\. They cannot provide feedback\. External users have **Viewer** as the default permission, and this can't be changed unless they are converted from a **Guest** to regular **User** by an administrator\.

1. Type a personal message \(if desired\) of no more than 2048 characters\.

1. Choose from the following options:
   + If you're sharing a folder, choose whether it is read\-only\. If the folder is not read\-only, users can upload new files or new versions of existing files to the folder\.
   + If you're sharing a file, choose **Request feedback** to ask for feedback\. You can also set deadlines for feedback requests\.
**Note**  
Feedback can only be requested for files, not folders\. Feedback can only be requested from users, not groups\.

1. Choose **Save**\. 

An email is sent to the invitees notifying them that a file or folder has been shared with them\. The email includes a web link to the file or folder, the personal message that was entered, and the feedback deadline, if one was specified\. The users/groups, along with their assigned role, are also added to the People tab\. If you receive an error message that indicates that you cannot share a document with people outside of your organization, your administrator has not authorized you to invite new users to the organization\. Contact your Amazon WorkDocs administrator for assistance\.
