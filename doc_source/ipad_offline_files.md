# Viewing Offline Files<a name="ipad_offline_files"></a>

You can download any file that you are authorized to download by viewing the document and opening the download icon\. This makes the file available on the device even if you are offline\. If the file you are viewing has already been downloaded, the download icon changes to a dark background\.

You can view your offline files by choosing **Offline Documents** in the navigation pane\. You can give feedback on a document even while offline\. Your feedback is synchronized to the server the next time you have Internet access\.
