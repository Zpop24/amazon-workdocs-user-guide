# Viewing Offline Files<a name="android_offline_files"></a>

You can download any file that you are authorized to download by viewing the document and opening the download icon \(![\[Amazon WorkDocs Android download icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/images/android_download_icon.png)\)\. This makes the file available on the device even if you are offline\. If the file you are viewing has already been downloaded, the download icon changes to a dark background \(![\[Amazon WorkDocs Android download icon\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/userguide/images/android_download_icon_downloaded.png)\)\.

You can view your offline files by choosing **Offline Documents** in the navigation pane\.

You can give feedback on a document even while offline\. Your feedback is synchronized to the server the next time you have Internet access\.
