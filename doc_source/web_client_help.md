## Log In<a name="web_login"></a>

When you launch the Amazon WorkDocs web client, log in with your organization name, user name, and password\. The organization name and user name are provided in the welcome email that you received from your Amazon WorkDocs administrator\. Your password was established when you completed the initial user registration\. For more information, see [Step 2: Register](getting_started.md#user_registration)\. 

If your Amazon WorkDocs administrator has enabled multi\-factor authentication \(MFA\) for your organization, you are also prompted for a passcode to complete your login\. Your Amazon WorkDocs administrator provides information about how to obtain your passcode\.

### Enabling Single Sign\-On<a name="single_sign_on"></a>

Amazon WorkDocs allows you to access Amazon WorkDocs from a computer that is joined to the same directory that Amazon WorkDocs is registered with, without having to enter your credentials separately\. If your Amazon WorkDocs administrator has enabled single sign\-on for your organization, you might need to take additional steps to enable your web browser to support single sign\-on\. For more information, see [Single Sign\-On for Internet Explorer and Google Chrome](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/ie_sso.html) and [Single Sign\-On for Firefox](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/firefox_sso.html) in the *AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*\.

**Note**  
Single sign\-on only works when used on a computer that is joined to the AWS Directory Service directory\. It can't be used on computers not joined to the directory\.
