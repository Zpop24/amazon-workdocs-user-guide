**People**  
The **People** tab displays the owner of a file and the people that the file is shared with\. People are identified by role: owner, viewer, or contributor\. From the web client, you can share a file, share a folder, or send a message\. This section also lets you change the permission of the user\.

**Feedback**  
**Feedback** displays the feedback that was saved for a file\. The overall feedback appears at the top, and the context\-specific feedback appears in order from the beginning to the end of the file\. You can scroll through the feedback and select a specific piece of feedback to review\. When you select a piece of feedback, the portion of the file that the feedback belongs to is scrolled into view\. Similarly, if you scroll through the file and select a highlighted portion of the file, the feedback for that portion is scrolled into view and selected\. The procedure for giving feedback on a file varies slightly depending on which collaboration client you are using\. For more information about giving feedback with a specific client, see [Amazon WorkDocs Clients](client_help.md)\.

**Filter**  
Allows you to filter the comments on the file based on file versions and users who have commented on the files\. You can also select to show draft comments, published comments, resolved comments, unresolved comments, and comments that mention your name\.
