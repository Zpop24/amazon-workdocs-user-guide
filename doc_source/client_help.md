**People**  
The **People** tab displays the owner of a file and the people that the file is shared with\. People are identified by role: owner, viewer, or contributor\.

From the web client, you can share a file, share a folder, or send a message\.
<a name="client_feedback"></a>
**Feedback**  
The **Feedback** displays the feedback that was saved for a file\. The overall feedback appears at the top, and the context\-specific feedback appears in order from the beginning to the end of the file\. You can scroll through the feedback and select a specific piece of feedback to review\. When you select a piece of feedback, the portion of the file that the feedback belongs to is scrolled into view\. Similarly, if you scroll through the file and select a highlighted portion of the file, the feedback for that portion is scrolled into view and selected\.

The procedure for giving feedback on a file varies slightly depending on which collaboration client you are using\. For more information about giving feedback with a specific client, see the documentation for the client\.
